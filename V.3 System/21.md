cat /etc/passwd | grep '/home' | cut -d : -f 1

Human users have UIDs starting at 1000, so you can use that fact to filter out the non-humans:
This cuts the first (username) and third (UID) colon-delimited fields from /etc/passwd, then filters for the resulting lines which end with a colon and four digits, then cuts the first (username) field from that, leaving you with a list of users with UIDs between 1000 and 9999.
