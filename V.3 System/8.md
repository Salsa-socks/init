Answer
(if you have no ssh key, one needs to be generated : ssh-keygen)
~/.ssh/id_rsa

Description
SSH, or secure shell, is an encrypted protocol used to administer and communicate with servers.
When working with a Debian server, chances are you will spend most of your time in a terminal session connected to your server through SSH.
SSH keys are a matching set of cryptographic keys which can be used for authentication. Each set contains a public and a private key. The public key can be shared freely without concern, while the private key must be vigilantly guarded and never exposed to anyone.

To authenticate using SSH keys, a user must have an SSH key pair on their local computer. On the remote server, the public key must be copied to a file within the userâ€™s home directory at ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. This file contains a list of public keys, one-per-line, that are authorized to log into this account.
